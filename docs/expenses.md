# Managing Expenses

Tracking your spending is the core of Keda.

## Adding an Expense

To add an expense, simply click on the category it belongs to on the dashboard. This will open a 3-step wizard:

1. **Amount**: Enter the transaction amount. You'll see a preview of how this affects your remaining budget.
2. **Details**: Add an optional note and select the date.
3. **Account**: Choose which account was used for the expense.

### Step 1: Amount
Enter the transaction amount. The progress bar at the top displays a real-time preview of how this expense will affect your remaining budget for the selected category.

### Step 2: Details
Add an optional note to describe the transaction and confirm the date. We've optimized the input field so it remains fully visible even when your mobile keyboard is open.

### Step 3: Account
Select which account was used for the payment. Your most frequently used account is selected by default to speed up the process.
